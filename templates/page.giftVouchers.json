We got together at the school gate in 2007 and came up with the idea of preparing dinners for time-poor friends and family members so that they woud always have good, homemade food in their fridges and freezers (and incidentally, so would we).<br\/>Between us we have seven children and two husbands of varying sizes, appetites and degrees of fussiness - there’s not much we don’t know about pleasing a tricky crowd.<br\/>We started cooking in the shed in Katherine’s back yard on a converted trailer and two camp stoves<br\/>We’d shop on a Monday, cook on a Tuesday and then one of us would do the delivery run while the other fed and bathed all the kids.<\/p>"
