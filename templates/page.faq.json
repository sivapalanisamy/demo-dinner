The system will recognise that you already have an order so we won't charge you again for shipping and will make sure your items are packed together. If your original slot does not appear, unfortunately you've missed the cut off to add to the order.<\/p>"

If you can't re-use the gel icepack, the contents can be mixed in with soil in pot plants or the garden to help retain water.<br\/>For more details go to...<\/p>"
